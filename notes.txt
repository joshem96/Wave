MINIMAL ISSUE BUGS//DO LATER
- prefbox still has bug that will crash website 
- left/right arrow doesnâ€™t do width transition when going to first or last image
- TP nag arrow could use a little more love, bugs out about 10% of the time 
- prefbox code seems to take out 1 extra img when declicked. something to do with remaindingImgArray
- when you backspace in searchBox, you lose an image when it does the INIT function
- in comView/pintrest, for example: if i click cyberpunk (12 imgs) then click vaporwave (5imgs) 
and scroll down (making loadImg 32 and displayed 17). then I click cyberpunk. it adds 14 imgs
to be displayed on screen (because fillRemaindIng img works on logic of if new cb's are click 
and displayed < loadImg then add loadImg number of imgs)
If i then declick cyberpunk (making loadImg 17, because loadImg = displayed when cb declicked)
and then click it again. I dont get images popping up like I did before because !displayed<loadImg
- pimg -> myView i lose an image in workingArray
-Occasionally when hitting the next arrow in myView itll trigger it repeditively
	PHOTOSHOP
	- change/redo sound mute icons

---	

CLEAN UP DO 
- change ".waveFm" and its variables to something like ".websiteLogo" or even make it an ID

---

POSSIBLE DO/DO LATER:
-pop up tag reminder when the photoViewSection is empty for more than 5s of where prefbox is
	-this repeats every 10s for intervals of like 3s
-possibly make a purple div to cover entire screen that gets removed upon load after 300-500ms
-make new name and logo
-change all nav arrows to img
- J and K comview facebook navigation
-if x is clicked in infoView and the menu is open, close menu and set brightness filter to 0
- make space bar start and stop for movie mode
- transition effect in movie mode for myView
-make a tabDisplay type code for topPageNavArrow, where when you have scrolled more than like 100px
  make it appear after no user interaction for like 5-10seconds
-"click and drag" for volume sound control
-find some transparent images
-make images fade in when you scroll them in
- optimize images onload (make it only resize workingArray images firs then do others once screen has
	loaded)
-make widths when styling the images to fit page (see functions on load)
- make pref code like a toggle/or, and to add more to working/comviewArry you need to hold cb for 2s
	AUDIO:
		- make electronic soundfx and A/B between the two
	CSS
	- make arrows bigger/smaller depending on screen size?
